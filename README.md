# Summary
This repository was made to keep track of ongoing analyses using the ***[Extrasensory dataset](http://extrasensory.ucsd.edu/)*** published by **Yonatan Vaizman** and **Katherine Ellis** at UCSD.

# What is here:
```/extrasense``` : This folder contains the python module I use to import helper functions I've made for my analysis.
```/notebooks``` : This folder contains a bunch of jupyter notebooks I've used track my experiments and analysis (Excuse the mess).
```/processes``` : This folder contains some of the batch scripts I've used mainly for running expensive parallelized experiments.
These typically don't run too well from the jupyter notebooks themselves.
```/results``` : This folder contains a bunch of pickled pandas DataFrames. My jupyter notebooks generally create and reference these 
later for visualization and analyses.
```/blogs``` : This where I'll keep any and all blogs that may come out of this project.
